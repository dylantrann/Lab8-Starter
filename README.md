1. Service workers provide a lower bound on performance, allowing for the product to start at maximum capacity and degrade to a lower quality version if the situation calls for it, ensuring a minimum functionality is maintained no matter what. The concept of graceful degradation is that the product starts at its full capacity and loses quality if the given user is unable to handle it the product at its full capacity, which is exactly what service workers do. They provide a back-up with less features to prevent the loss of data/functionality.
